# Adherence-to-Medication
This repository makes available the scripts built for the study of adhesion to medication among participants of an out-of-pocket financial assistance program managed by the ONG [Dignitude.](https://www.dignitude.org/)  

Research conducted with the support of [NOVA National School of Public Health.](https://www.ensp.unl.pt/home/) 

### About:
<p align="justify">In these files, you will find data wrangling and transformation and statistical analysis using R.
  
Implementation was measured using Continuous Multiple Interval Measure of Medication Acquisition (CMA) and Continuous Multiple Interval Measure of Medication Gaps (CMG). These outcomes were analysed using negative binomial mixed effects models and zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects models.
  
Discontinuation was assessed using Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) curves and mixed effects Cox models. 
  
A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was performed for the main input variables (grace period coefficient and gap to discontinuation). Those files have the respective input variable value in their name. 
  
Research paper will be available soon.</p>
